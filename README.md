## Introduction

This project aims to restructure this JSON dataset by extracting it to DBeaver using SQL database and joining the extracted values 
with the original table. I will clean the data with SQL queries by handling missing values, 
removing duplicates and converting data types, if necessary. Using this new set of data, I hope 
to conduct some basic exploratory data analyses such as summarizing its descriptive statistics 
and visualizing the data to gain insights and identify patterns and correlations within the 
dataset. Last but not least, I plan to explore the distribution of review ratings to understand the 
overall satisfaction level of customers. I will divide the reviews to positive reviews (4 or 5 stars), 
neutral reviews (2-3 stars) and negative reviews (0 or 1 star) to study the rating distribution on 
Kindle and how the customers’ satisfaction level is distributed on Kindle.
If time allows, I would like to utilize NLP or a pre-trained model to conduct a sentiment 
analysis on the actual text reviews on the dataset as well. By doing so, I can classify reviews as 
positive, negative, or neutral and study their distribution within existing reviews.
Since I’m doing the project by myself, all work would be accomplished by me.
